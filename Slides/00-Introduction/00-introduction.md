# Introduction

## Module 18: Blockchain with Python

Congratulations on successfully navigating all the challenges that this course has presented so far! Your projects will provide tangible proof of both your efforts and your enthusiasm for becoming a member of the fintech workforce.

We’ll now move on to **blockchain**, an emerging technology with potential uses everywhere from cryptocurrency to traditional banking, healthcare, and real estate. Because of its wide applicability, blockchain is currently disrupting institutions around the globe. But, why exactly is blockchain useful, and what benefits can it bring to you, your business, and the world? In this module, you’ll dive deeply into the cutting edge of technological innovation. Specifically, you’ll use basic blockchain data structures and networking to create powerful shared record systems that inherently have security, verifiability, and trustworthiness.

In this module, you’ll learn why, at a deeper level, blockchains can ease transactions through the high-quality design of economic incentives. You’ll then apply this knowledge to building your own blockchain that anyone in the world can access and use.

### Preview This Week's Challenge

For this module’s Challenge, you will build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger will allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

We'll review the Challenge assignment in class, so you'll have plenty of time to ask questions. To review the assignment ahead of time, go to the Challenge page.

## Module 18 Getting Started

In this module, you’ll need Streamlit. It’s the Python library for building web interfaces for your Python applications.

To install the Streamlit library, check that your `dev` virtual environment is active, and then run the following command:

```shell
pip install streamlit
```
